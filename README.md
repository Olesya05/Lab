# Lab1

## Clonning repository to PC
1. I used `git clone` https://github.com/Olesya05/Lab.git

2. I used `git log` to show the hash of previous commit:daf68113480b5fb9d2bb882c93103b14ab62d738

3. I used `git branch` branch_1 to create new a branch and `git checkout` to switch to branch_1

4. NO changes because we was on another branch.
